"""Shared plumbing for the added-line style checks.

Both ``check_style.py`` (textual conventions) and ``clang_tidy_hook.py``
(clang-tidy conventions) need the same two things: the set of line numbers a
change ADDED to each file, and the ability to turn a tool call, in the Claude
Code form ``agent_hooks.py`` gives every harness's payload, into that set.
That logic lives here so the two checkers cannot drift apart in what they
consider an added line.

Run directly to emit a clang-tidy ``--line-filter`` argument for the files a
diff touches, which is how ``ci/scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh`` restricts an MR's
diagnostics to its own lines:
